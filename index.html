            Hello World!
        </h1>
        <h3>A bit about me.</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a French and Canadian student at the University of Waterloo, in the Faculty of Mathematics. I'm working towards a Pure Math major, joint honors in Combinatorics & Optimization and maybe a Classical Studies minor. I was born in Paris and later moved to Montreal at the age of 9.
        </p>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>
            I've always liked numbers and their properties, so I've quickly developped an interest in cryptography, mostly in the efforts to break the Enigma code during World War II. I have a soft spot for history, it started with a healthy obsession with Ancient Egypt and Rome as a child, and high school added French and Russian history as well as the two World Wars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up in Montreal, it wasn't hard to become a fan of the Montreal Canadiens. I am a huge sports fan: hockey, football, soccer, gymnastics, basketball, you name it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Video games. I've helped Mario and Link save their princesses, become a Pokemon master many times (currently working on Y and Crystal), taken over continents, nuked Gandhi, hated myself after the Plague mission in Warcraft III, escaped Castle Wolfenstein and more. I've been addicted to FPS games. While Unreal Tournament 1999 is still my all time favorite, I've spent many hours on Urban Terror, Half Life 2, Left for Dead 2, Team Fortress 2 and played a bit of Battlefield, Counter-Strike, Halo CE, Call of Duty, etc... I've also rage-quit over losing my best pickaxes and sword in my favorite Minecraft world; destroyed countless Nexuses; and survived zombie apocalypses, both virtual and in real life.
        </p>
