            Hello World!
        </h1>
        <h3>A bit about me.</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a French and Canadian student at the University of Waterloo, in the Faculty of Mathematics. I'm working towards a Pure Math major, joint honors in Combinatorics & Optimization and maybe a Classical Studies minor. I was born in Paris and later moved to Montreal at the age of 9.

        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>
            I've always liked numbers and their properties, so I've quickly developped an interest in cryptography, mostly in the efforts to break the Enigma code during World War II. I have a soft spot for history, it started with a healthy obsession with Ancient Egypt and Rome as a child, and high school added French and Russian history as well as the two World Wars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up in Montreal, it wasn't hard to become a fan of the Montreal Canadiens. I am a huge sports fan: hockey, football, soccer, gymnastics, basketball, you name it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Video games. I've helped Mario and Link save their princesses, become a Pokemon master many times (currently working on Y and Crystal), taken over continents, nuked Gandhi, escaped Castle Wolfenstein and more. I've been addicted to shooters, Unreal Tournament 1999 comes to mind; rage-quit over losing my best pickaxes and sword in my favorite world; destroyed countless Nexuses; and survived zombie apocalypses, both virtual and in real life.
