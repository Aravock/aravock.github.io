        <h3>Customize your Lync Meetings</h3>
        <p>
            When you're scheduling your Lync Meetings, you can use the default options, which are appropriate for small and casual meetings with coworkers. It's a good idea to modify the options if:
            <ul>
                <li>You're inviting more than 10-15 people. You can have up to 250 participants.</li>
                <li>You want to control participants' permissions, (IM, Audio, Video).</li>
                <li>You want to have a new meeting ID, which allows only people you invite to join, (added security).</li>
                <li>You have invitees from other companies.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Lync Meeting options are located in your Outlook calendar. We'll go through the available choices for the meeting you're scheduling.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Where do you want to meet online?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Here you can choose if you want to use your assigned meeting space, or create a new space (meeting ID), and set restrictions and permissions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <em>A new meeting space (I control permissions)</em> 
                                    This option is more secure, and suitable for when you present confidential information. You get a brand new meeting with a unique ID, and can customize permissions such as who gets to be a presenter, mute people or prevent them from sharing video. When you use this option and get a new meeting space, participants from your previous meetings don't accidentally join your next meeting, in case they remain online. Also with a new meeting space, you can add additional security and only allow people who you want to join. If you want to always use this option, click <strong>Remember Settings</strong> at the bottom of the window, so that all your future meetings automatically have a new ID and the permissions you select.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                   <em>My dedicated meeting space (less secure)</em>
                                   This is simply your own meeting room and will always have the same ID and permissions. Content, such as PowerPoint presentations or other files remain in the meeting until you delete them. This is a good option for informal meetings with coworkers, which lets them sign in at any time with presenter permissions.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>These people don't have to wait in the lobby.</h4>
                    <p>
                        You decide who gets into the meeting directly, and who has to wait to be let in. When the meeting starts, you see the names of the people who want to join the meeting and can grant or deny access.

                    <p>
                        Presenters have full control over the meeting, and can share content, record the meeting, change options, mute people, and other meeting-related tasks.
