        <h2>Lync Presence</h2>
        <h3>What it is and why you should use it</h3>
        <p>
            Presence statuses include Available, Busy, Away, and Do Not Disturb. Your status is based on your Microsoft Outlook Calendar, if you use Outlook, or your Lync activities. For example, if you have a meeting currently scheduled in Outlook, your status appears as "In a meeting" in Lync. When you're in a Lync audio or video call, your presence indicator appears red, as Busy, and your status is updated to "In a call." But you can also control your presence status manually, and set a personal note visible to your Contacts to let people know what you're up to. This will help your coworkers save time when trying to contact you!
        </p>
        <h3>How/When to use it</h3>
        <h4>Changing your presence status</h4>
        <p>
            Click on the down arrow under your name, and choose one of the statuses in the drop-down menu. If you want Lync to automatically update your status, select Reset Status from the drop-down menu.
        </p>

                    Lync sets this status when it detects you're using your computer. You can also set this status when you want others to know you're in your office even though the computer is idle.

                    Lync sets this status when, according to your Outlook Calendar, if you use Outlook, you have an appointment. You can also select this status from the drop-down arrow. If you're in a call, a meeting or a Lync conference call, the text will change to reflect this.
