        <h2>Instant Messaging (IM)</h2>
        <p>
            Sending an IM:
            <ol>
                <li>Right click on a contact name and select Send an IM or double click on the contact's name. You can send an IM to multiple people at the same time by pressing the Ctrl key while you click the names of the people you want to add to the conversation.</li>
                <li>Type your message in the text box and send by pressing Enter.</li>
            </ol>
            While IM conversations are secure, they may be recorded by participants. It is recommended to keep a professional tone and to avoid sharing restricted or confidential information.
        </p>
        <p>
           When you receive a message from a contact, you'll see their profile picture pop up in one of your screen's corners. Click anywhere on the picture display area of the request window, you'll see an Accept prompt as you point at the window, in order to start talking to them.
        </p>
        <h2>Audio and Video Calls</h2>
        <h3>Making and Receiving calls</h3>
        <p>
            You can use Lync to make a call to a group of people. Selecting their names in the contact list while pressing Ctrl, then right click and select Start a Conference Call (Audio) or Start a Video Call. End the call at any time by closing the window, end your video by pausing on the camera icon and choosing Stop My Video, or end all the videos and keep only audio by pressing End Video.
        </p>
        <p>
            When someone calls you, just like for IMs, you'll see their profile picture pop up in one of your screen's corners. To answer the call, you can click anywhere on the photo. You can also reject the call and send it to Voice Mail by pressing Ignore. Choose Options for other actions:
            <ul>
                <li>Send the call to Voice Mail</li>
                <li>Redirect the call to your Mobile or Home phone</li>
                <li>Reply by IM instead of audio or video</li>
                <li>Answer with Audio Only if you do not want to show your video</li>
                <li>Set to Do Not Disturb to reject the call and avoid any others</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Working with Voicemail</h3>
        <p>
            Your voice mails are saved both in Lync and Outlook. When you have new voice mail, the Phone tab in the Lync main window displays the number of your messages. Here's how to listen to them:
            <ol>
                <li>Click the Phone tab to see your messages and the caller's info.</li>
                <li>Hover on a voice mail picture and click the arrow to Play.</li>
                <li>Click More Options, and select one of the following choices:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Call the contact.</li>
                        <li>Start a Video Call with the contact.</li>
                        <li>See the Contact's card.</li>
                        <li>Open Item in Outlook to see more information about the call.</li>
                        <li>Delete Item to remove the voice mail from Lync.</li>
                        <li>Mark Item as Read.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
