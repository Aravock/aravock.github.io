    <h2>Using Contacts</h2>
    <h3>Find & Add contacts</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place yourself in the main window of Lync and click the search field. You can then type the name, email address or phone number of the person you want to add.</li>
            <li>Right click on their name, and select Add to Contact List.</li>
            <li>Choose which Contact group you want this person to be a part of.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Adding external contacts</h3>
    <p>
        Lync lets you add contacts from another organization, who use Lync or Skype.
        <ol>
            <li>In the Lync main window, click on the Contact icon under your picture and select Add a contact <img src="Images/add-contact.png"></img> > Add a Contact Not in my Organization.</li>
            <li>Click the contact's IM provider, Lync or Skype.</li>
            <li>In the IM address box, enter your new contract.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Choose a group and privacy relationship for this contact - see below.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Using Groups</h3>
    <p>
        Lync groups are collections of contacts that you create, and are only visible to you. You can communicate with the contacts in a group, all at the same time! This is extremely useful for group projects, etc... Note that Lync automatically assigns new contacts to Other Contacts (with "Colleague" access level) if you don't put them in a specific group.
    </p>
    <p>
        Create a group:
        <ol>
            <li>In the Lync main window, click on the Contact icon under your picture and select Add a contact <img src="Images/add-contact.png"></img> > Create a New Group.</li>
            <li>Write a name for your group and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
            <li>Add contacts by dragging them from your contact list or from search.</li>
        </ol>
        Delete a group by right-clicking its heading and selecting Delete Group on the drop-down list. You can also rename a group, or change the order in which your groups are displayed, from this same drop-down list. 
    </p>
    <h3>Relationship Options - Who sees what</h3>
    <p>
        In Lync, privacy relationships control how much of your presence information others see. Each of your contacts has one of five privacy relationships with you, and each relationship gives access to a different amount of information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Change the privacy relationship you have with a contact by right-clicking their name and in the drop-down menu, choosing Change Privacy Relationship.
